## AI Task: Complete README Transformation

Hello Cursor AI! Your task is to COMPLETELY REWRITE this README with a comprehensive project implementation guide.

### Critical Requirements:

1. **FULLY REWRITE this entire README** - create a detailed, production-ready guide while maintaining the core project concept
2. **Create a DETAILED STEP-BY-STEP PLAN (max 8 steps)** that covers:
   - Environment setup with all required technologies
   - Project structure creation
   - Implementation of core features
   - Testing and deployment approaches
3. **Tailor content to the user's profile:**
   - User's Experience Level: `Beginner`
   - User's Available Time: `A Few Hours`
4. **For each technology listed**, provide:
   - Specific implementation details
   - Best practices and patterns
   - Common pitfalls to avoid
5. **Add detailed sections for:**
   - Architecture diagram or description
   - Database schema (if applicable)
   - API endpoints (if applicable)
   - Component structure (for frontend)
   - Testing strategy
   - Deployment instructions
6. **Provide code examples** for critical project parts
7. **REMOVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY** after your rewrite

Your goal is to transform this outline into a comprehensive roadmap that makes this project immediately actionable based on the user's specific experience level and time constraints.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FIRST STEP ‚ö†Ô∏è

**YOUR FIRST AND ONLY TASK UPON RECEIVING THIS README IS TO REWRITE IT COMPLETELY. DO NOT START IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT OR WRITING ANY CODE YET.**

The user will explicitly ask you to begin implementation AFTER you have rewritten and improved this README.

# Treasure Hunt Adventure

## Project Overview
Create a simple puzzle adventure game where players navigate through a treasure map, solving puzzles to unlock the next stage. The game will feature a grid-based map, with players using arrow keys to move their character. Each stage will have a unique puzzle to solve, and the game will keep track of the player's progress.


> **üí° Quick Start:** After cloning this repository and opening it in Cursor, simply tell the AI: "Read the README and guide me through implementing this project step by step." Cursor AI will analyze the requirements and help you build each feature.


## User Profile
- **Experience Level:** Beginner
- **Available Time to Complete:** A Few Hours

## Technologies
- **Phaser**: A popular open-source framework for creating HTML5 games. It provides a robust set of features for creating interactive games, including support for graphics, animation, and input handling.
- **JavaScript**: Used for creating the game logic, handling user input, and updating the game state.
- **HTML5**: Used for rendering the game UI and layout.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the game UI and layout.


## Development Steps
### 1. Setup Phaser Project
Create a new Phaser project using the Phaser CLI, and set up the basic game structure.

### 2. Create Game Assets
Design and create the game assets, including the treasure map, player character, and puzzle elements.

### 3. Implement Game Logic
Write the JavaScript code to handle user input, update the game state, and implement the puzzle logic.

### 4. Add Puzzle Mechanics
Implement the puzzle mechanics, including grid-based movement and puzzle solving.

### 5. Test and Debug
Test the game and debug any issues that arise.

### 6. Add UI and Sound Effects
Add a user interface to display the player's progress and sound effects to enhance the gameplay experience.

### 7. Polish and Refine
Polish the game by adding animations, transitions, and other visual effects to enhance the overall gameplay experience.


## Main Features
Features will be added soon


## Sample Code
```javascript
// Example code snippet for creating a Phaser scene
function create() {
  this.add.image(400, 300, 'treasure-map');
}
```


## Getting Started
Instructions will be added soon

## AI Coding Prompts

Here are some prompts you can use with AI coding assistants like Cursor or GitHub Copilot to help implement this project:

### Prompt 1
```
Create a new Phaser game scene with a starter code for the Treasure Hunt Adventure project. Include a single image element that represents the treasure map. Use Phaser's `add.image` method to add the image to the scene, and specify the image's x and y coordinates, as well as the image's key ('treasure-map').
```

### Prompt 2
```
Implement the player movement mechanics for the Treasure Hunt Adventure game. Use Phaser's ` cursors` object to detect keyboard input (arrow keys) and update the player's position accordingly. Also, add a collision detection system to check for collisions between the player and the treasure map's grid.
```

### Prompt 3
```
Enhance the game by adding a unique puzzle to each stage. Use Phaser's `input` object to detect user input (e.g., clicking on an object) and trigger a specific puzzle logic. For example, you can create a simple encryption puzzle where the player must decode a message to unlock the next stage.
```


Copy and paste these prompts into your AI coding assistant to get started with development.
